# Technologies Used

* [Materialize] (http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/)- This project used Materialize to implement semantic web design markup.

* [Materializecss](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/)- I have used Materializecss  for styling the site.

* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)-This project used Heroku to Deploy my project and makes it easy to create and manage Heroku apps directly from the terminal.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)- MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

* [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html)- Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.

# Testing

The main testing of this site was done to test resposiveness of the overall site for every page in Mobile and Tablet, portrait, landscape and Desktop views via local host.

* Tested on Google Chrome Dev tools on all screen resolutions available in dev tools in both portrait and landscape modes.

2. [CSS Validador](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

3. [PHP Checker](https://phpcodechecker.com/)

* Tested entire site on Responsinator as backup to ensure responsiveness. [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com), works on different browsers and screen sizes.

# Non Local Host Testing

* Tested entire site on [Responsinator][http://www.responsinator.com] as backup to ensure responsiveness.

# Features

* When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality.
The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources. Ability to perform at most these four functions in order to be complete.

- Create — This would consist of a function which we would call when a new library book is being added to the catalog.

- Read —  This would consist of a function which would be called to see all of the books currently in the catalog.

- Update — There should be a function to call when information about a book must be changed.

- Delete — There should be a function to call to remove a library book from the catalog.

# Existing Features:

* In my milestone project file in GitHub you will find Images , no needed in this project.(e.g. fundo.jpg, guy-image.png, patient.jpg ).

# Features left to implement: 

* Login and Password form 

# Deployment

* I used Heroku to Deploy my App. 
* Before deploy app to Heroku, I needed to initialize a local Git repository and commit your application code to it.

#### Creating a Heroku remote

- Deploy your app by pushing its code to a special Heroku-hosted remote that’s associated with your app.

- To Deploy this App, I needed to Push code first on GitHub and than through Heroku, and I needed an IP, a PORT and MONGO_URI 
1. IP - 0.0.0.0
2. PORT - 3000
3. MONGO_URI
